  <article>
    <p>So you want to level up your coffee game? Maybe you don’t want to feel lost when looking at the menu in that fancy cafe, or maybe you want to know what your friend means when they say they’re “really into Ethiopias right now,” or maybe you’re just here as part of a peer review session for your WR121Z class with Professor Kyle Nunes. No matter the reason, if you’re interested in learning more about specialty coffee, you’re in the right place.</p>

    <h2>What’s the Big Deal?</h2>
    <p>
      Coffee is coffee, right? What’s the deal with all the lingo getting thrown around by the over-caffeinated twenty-something at your neighborhood coffee shop? Is any of it really that different from what you’re making at home? These are all completely valid questions, and they point out a really interesting part of this whole equation: specialty coffee isn’t the norm. Most of the world is still drinking coffee the same way they have been since the mid-20th century (Jolliffe). But like everything during these turbulent times, coffee is changing. My hope is that by the end of this, you’ll understand why, how, and why you might want to come along for the ride.

    <h2>Third-Wave Coffee</h2>
    <p>
      Third-wave coffee is the main term used to describe this modern movement in the coffee world, and to understand it requires an understanding of the first two waves. The first wave of coffee refers to a time when coffee became a commodity. During this time, coffee distributors gave little thought or reverence to the coffee itself, the methods from farming to brewing, or the overall flavor. Think Folgers, Maxwell House, Green Mountain Coffee, and other brands that don’t have a strong focus on quality or sourcing transparency (“Coffee Waves Explained”). When I think of first-wave coffee, I think of very dark roasts, pre-ground tubs, and old-school diners.
    </p>
    <p>
      Second-wave coffee is typically associated with Starbucks—this is when coffee started gaining traction as more than just a source of caffeine. This time is really marked by the first moment a coffee shop with the primary product being coffee drinks became viable as a business. We still see plenty of these first two waves in the world today: you probably know someone who has that classic red Folgers tub in their kitchen, and you may have even stopped at a Starbucks this morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a couple of ways that third-wave sets itself apart. The most obvious is that it’s fancy—and you’re not wrong! “A third-wave coffee shop barista orients to coffee similarly to how sommeliers do to wine: one does not view coffee as mere beverage, but a serious connoisseurship” (Lee and Ruck). But this is only part of the story. What’s more important is the respect third-wave coffee pays every step along the production line from plant to cup. In other words, the time it took for that barista to learn how to make that fancy tulip drawing on top of your latte is a reflection of the care and respect third-wave coffee has for the roasters, producers, growers, and even the coffee plants themselves. In a world where global warming and overconsumption threaten the population of coffee plants globally, and the sharp teeth of capitalism keep coffee farmers in the Global South paid less than livable wages, third-wave coffee looks to respect the entire process: fair trade and livable wages for the growers, a roasting process that doesn’t burn the beans to a crisp, and a barista with enough knowledge and training to ensure that coffee tastes good enough in your cup to justify that $7 price tag that makes all of this possible.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>So… Now What?</h2>
    <p>
      What does this mean for you? Is the way you’ve been doing things wrong? Do you need to change? Not if you don’t want to! Although there are certainly values behind third-wave coffee, the most important factor is whether it’s right for you. I wouldn’t push anyone to spend $20 on a bag of coffee if they’re just as happy with what they have now. But if any of this interests you, it’s definitely worth exploring! Here are some ways you can get involved, including a pour-over recipe you can do at home in under 5 minutes that will really bring out all of the flavors in whatever beans you choose.
    </p>
  </article>

  <article>
    <h2>1. Your Choice of Beans</h2>
    <p>
      If you really want to respect the growers, roasters, producers, and the earth—but can’t see yourself shelling out $20 every other week for a bag of beans—don’t fret! Although the beans at your local third-wave shop may be expensive, they aren’t the only ones that demonstrate these values. One easy way is to look for some type of fair trade certification. There are multiple versions, and I always encourage doing your own research, but in general if you see any of these logos on your bag, you can feel better knowing the farmers and producers responsible for growing those beans were paid fairly for their hard work.
    </p>
    <img src="Fair.jpg" alt="Fair trade label" class="hero-image">
    <p class="caption"><a href="https://www.fairtrade.net/us-en.html" target="_blank">Fair trade certifications</a></p>
    <p>
      Another quick and easy way to sort out the beans that may be right for you is to look for an origin. Coffee is grown around the world in very specific places that provide the sun, temperature, and moisture the plants need—these places all fall along the “bean belt.” In general, when a coffee roaster puts the origin of the beans right on the bag, they’re making a statement: not only do they care about where the beans were sourced from and aren’t just giving you any random blend, but they likely roasted those beans to bring out the flavors and textures that are special to coffee grown in that region. This is also a great way to find out what you like and start developing your coffee palette.
    </p>

  <article>
    <h2>2. Learn More!</h2>
    <p>
      So you’ve got your beans picked out, but you still want to learn more about third-wave coffee. That’s great! There are plenty of ways you can go from here. In my own coffee journey, learning how to really taste coffee was an important step—going from thinking all coffee tastes the same to being able to pick out chocolatey, nutty, floral, and even fruity notes is a big part of what made me fall in love with the craft. But I was trained as a barista—how are you supposed to learn how to taste without training?
    </p>
    <p>
      The great thing is that most third-wave shops want to give you that same experience. Check out the shops in your area, identify some that sound good to you, and just go taste different coffees made by professionals in the craft. Ask what the barista prefers, what you’re supposed to be tasting—just ask questions! Most of us are more than happy to chat your ear off about the beans, because again, we love this stuff.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some cafes even host public events called cuppings. Cupping is how coffee is tasted in the industry—from roasters to cafes—in order to distinguish between different batches, dial in roast profiles, and train palates. Look around and see if any of your local cafes host these events. It can be a great way to get some guidance and experience with tasting different coffees. Once you start tasting the differences, you’ll be excited to extract all the special flavors from that bag of beans you got—so the next step is taking them home and making some great coffee!
    </p>

    <h2>3. Making Coffee at Home</h2>
    <p>
      If you’re anything like me, the excitement of this brand new world of coffee might make you want to run out and buy a fancy espresso machine—until… what? This costs more than my car?? Yes, the world of espresso can be a costly endeavor, but that’s not your only choice when it comes to making great coffee at home.
    </p>
    <p>
      You may already have a setup—an automatic drip brewer, a moka pot, a French press—whatever you’ve got, a little research and a YouTube rabbit hole can help you bring the best out of your beans. Don’t have a solid brew method? Some of the best options for brewing great coffee can also be the cheapest. My recommendation would be to get yourself a pour-over dripper. There are plenty of options, from the ever-popular Hario V60 to a 99¢ funnel from IKEA that landed Amadeo Burcel in 6th place at the Indonesia Brewers Cup (yes, there are competitions for this stuff.)
    </p>
    <div class="image-row">
      <div>
        <img src="ikea.jpg" alt="IKEA funnel">
        <p class="caption"><a href="https://www.ikea.com/us/en/p/uppfylld-funnel-bright-yellow-80521930/" target="_blank">IKEA UPPFYLLD</a></p>
      </div>
      <div>
        <img src="ikea2.jpeg" alt="IKEA pour over setup">
        <p class="caption"><a href="https://www.hudesmagazine.com/2025/03/amadeos-game-changing-ikea-funnel-hack.html" target="_blank">Amadeo Yurcel</a></p>
      </div>
    </div>
    <p>
      Whichever way you go, a simple plastic or ceramic pour-over dripper and a couple of paper filters can get you a long way with coffee extraction. That’s all well and good, but you still need a grinder. These can get pretty expensive pretty quickly, but if you don’t have one, there are still plenty of good options. Manual grinders can be found online or at some cafes starting as low as $20 and work the same way as the most expensive options—you just have to do the work by hand. I’d recommend looking for anything with a burr, as it gives much more consistent grind sizes than a grinder that uses blades.
    </p>
    <p>
      The second option is completely free! Just ask a friend or family member who has a coffee grinder and grind your whole bag to take home with you, or if you’re buying your beans from a local coffee shop, just ask the barista and they’ll grind it for you before you even walk out of the store. Although the idea of grinding fresh for each cup you make is great, it’s not always realistic. Getting your freshly roasted beans ground when you buy them keeps them as fresh as possible and is miles better than any pre-ground beans you’ll find at the grocery store that might’ve been ground weeks or months ago.

    <h2>About the Author</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Calvin Sewell—an engineering student at Portland State University and a third-wave coffee barista. I’ve worked in cafes across Los Angeles and Portland, and I spend a lot of time at home researching, brewing, and appreciating great coffee. I believe in the humanitarian and ecological principles that drive third-wave coffee culture, and I love sharing that passion with others. My go-to is light-roasted African coffees, especially Ethiopian, from local roasters like 
      <a href="https://www.heartroasters.com/" target="_blank">Heart</a> or 
      <a href="https://www.sterling.coffee/" target="_blank">Sterling</a>, brewed on my V60 at home.
